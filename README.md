# DSA Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms (DSA) in JavaScript. It's a collection of code examples that you can use to learn, practice, and understand fundamental DSA concepts.

## Data Structures:

### Arrays:
* Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort)
* Searching algorithms (linear search, binary search)

### Linked Lists:
* Singly linked lists
* Doubly linked lists
  
### Stacks:
- Implementation using arrays or linked lists

### Queues:
- Implementation using arrays or linked lists

### Trees:
* Binary trees
* Binary search trees

### Graphs:
* Breadth-first search (BFS)
* Depth-first search (DFS)
